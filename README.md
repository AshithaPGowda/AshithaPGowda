# Hi, I'm Ashitha Paramesha Gowda

I'm a passionate **Full Stack Developer** with a focus on **Backend Development**. I'm also the founder of [cnotes.in](https://cnotes.in). I'm excited about building innovative solutions, leveraging the latest technologies, and creating impactful projects.

### üöÄ Current Focus:
- Building and deploying **Ethereum smart contracts** and integrating with **Metamask API**.
- Designing and developing user-friendly interfaces using **MUI v6** and modern frontend frameworks.
- Exploring **blockchain** technologies and how they can be integrated into real-world applications.
- Still in the midst of my academic journey at **Johns Hopkins University** ‚Äî that's why most of my projects are *still* academic-focused. I promise I‚Äôm not just coding in my home and calling it "research"! üòÖ

### üõ†Ô∏è Current Projects:

- [**cnotes.in**](https://cnotes.in): Cnotes is meticulously crafted to streamline the organization and simplification of how you maintain and manage your cable TV subscribers. Immerse yourself in the substantial benefits of efficient Collection Management, SMS Receipts for customers, and addressing last-mile payment leakages in your cable TV business through our Automated Billing and Customer Management Software.
- **Dear**: A personalized voice assistant designed to simulate a phone call between Alzheimer's patients and a family member. It uses Cartesia to deep clone the family member's voice and VAPI to initiate the phone call. The AI model generates prompts to maintain the conversation, aiming to help Alzheimer's patients simulate memory and engage in meaningful interactions.
- **Patent verification system**: 
The Patent Verification System is a blockchain-based project designed to securely and transparently verify and manage patent ownership, submissions, and intellectual property (IP) rights. By leveraging blockchain's immutability, the system ensures that patent information, including submission dates, ownership, and modification history, is securely recorded and cannot be altered once verified. This prevents fraud, protects against IP disputes, and provides a reliable record for patent holders, researchers, and legal entities. The system can be used to track the life cycle of a patent, from its initial filing to its expiration or licensing, ensuring clear and verifiable ownership and protecting intellectual property in a decentralized manner.
